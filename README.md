Parallel_Algorithms
===================

Coding assigments for parallel algorithms

These three folders are copied directly from my repository for my parallel algorithms class.
Each contain multiple supporting files not written by me. My code can be found in the StudentSolution.cpp
file, where I wrote all of the functions shown in each of those files.

Most problems will have been solved with both a sequential and a parallel implementation, as was asked
of us in the class.
